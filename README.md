**Machine Learning Project - Diamond Price Prediction**

This project is a **regression-based machine learning model** that predicts diamond prices using real-world data. The project also features a **fully functional web application** built using the **Flask** framework, allowing users to interact with the model through a web interface.

## Features

- Followed a clean project structure with folders like artifacts, notebooks, src, and more — to simulate production-grade ML workflows.
- Conducted thorough EDA, feature engineering, and model selection to improve performance.
- Implemented pipelines, custom modules, and tracking for reproducibility.
- Regression model training and evaluation
- Web interface for real-time diamond price prediction

## Dataset

The dataset used is obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data), **Bengaluru House Data**, which contains 10 independent variables (icluding id) :

- id : unique identifier of each diamond
- carat : Carat (ct.) refers to the unique unit of weight measurement used exclusively to weigh gemstones and diamonds.
- cut : Quality of diamond cut.
- color : Color of Diamond
- clarity : Diamond clarity is a measure of the purity and rarity of the stone, graded by the visibility of these characteristics under 10-power magnification.
- depth : The depth of diamond is its height (in mm) measured from the culet (bottom tip) to the table (flat, top surface)
- table : A diamond's table is the facet which can be seen when the stone is viewed face up.
- x : Diamond X dimension
- y : Diamond Y dimension
- z : Diamond Z dimension

## Project Workflow

1. Creating a new conda environment.
2. Build a clean project structure with folders like artifacts, notebooks, src, and more — to simulate production-grade ML workflows.
3. Import necessary libraries
4. Load and inspect dataset
5. Perform EDA and feature engineering  
6. Export cleaned data
7. Model building and evaluation
8. Create frontend
9. Backend integration using Flask
